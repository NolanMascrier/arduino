Shared project between [42 Le Havre](https://42lehavre.fr/en/homepage-en/) and [Asadhar](https://esadhar.fr/fr/lecole-superieure-dart-design-havre-rouen-0). Using Arduinos Nano BLE 33, the objective was to make a "physical" AI, one that could interact with the physical world, within 5 days. The fun challenge added was that the AI needed to represent a mental ilness; My partner and I chose paranoia, based around the concept of personnal spaces.

The project needed only bases due to the collaboration with non-programmers, but developped many other skills, notably the use of electronics, embeded device programmation, LLM uses, artistic expression, and collaborative effort.
